Emart
Why settle for clunky online shopping when you can build something fast, beautiful, and intuitive? Emart is my personal project, designed to deliver a seamless, visually appealing e-commerce experience with a modern, responsive UI.

🔹 Built With: Flutter (because smooth animations = happy users)
🔹 Front-End Highlights:
✔️ Sleek UI/UX – Clean, modern design with intuitive navigation
✔️ Lightning-Fast Performance – Optimized for buttery-smooth scrolling & animations
✔️ Dark Mode – Because, let’s be honest, it just looks cooler 😎
✔️ State Management Mastery – Getx(Flutter)
✔️ Micro-Interactions & Animations – Lottie to add that extra polish
✔️ Mobile-First & Responsive – Works flawlessly across all screen sizes

Emart is more than just a shopping app—it’s my playground for front-end magic
